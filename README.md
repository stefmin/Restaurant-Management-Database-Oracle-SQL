## 🧰 How to Run  

1. Open Oracle SQL Developer or any Oracle-compatible client.  
2. Run the scripts in the following order:
   - `creare_tabele.sql` → creates the base schema  
   - `inserare_date.sql` → populates tables with sample data  
   - `queries.sql` → runs the analytical and business queries
